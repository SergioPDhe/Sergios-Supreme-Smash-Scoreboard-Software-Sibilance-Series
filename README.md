Scoreboard software for streaming Super Smash Bros Melee

This is some software I made in 2018 and then uploaded to reddit after I got to use it for a while in early 2019.

I mainly made this because I was tired of using "Scoreboard Assistant" and having it crash/not work every other week.

## How it works

The software uses a folder that the user selects when you first start up the program. All it does is save .txt and .png files to that directory, which you can then use with a streaming software like OBS to easily update everything.

It is currently built for Super Smash Bros. Melee, but could be used with other games if you don't mind not using stock icons.

Otherwise the UI is pretty self-explanatory.
